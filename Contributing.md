# Planetary Software Organization Community Contributing Guide

This document describes a very simple process suitable for activities
in the Planetary Software Organization ecosystem, including the TSC
itself.

The goal of this document is to create a contribution process that:

* Encourages new contributions.
* Encourages contributors to remain involved.
* Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible.
* Creates a transparent decision making process which makes it clear how
contributors can be involved in decision making.


## Vocabulary

* A **Contributor** is any individual creating or commenting on an
	issue or pull request.
* A **Committer** is a subset of contributors who have been given
	write access to the repository.
* A **Technical Committee (TC)** is a group of committers representing
	the required technical expertise to resolve rare disputes.
	For the purpose of this repository, the Planetary Software
	Technical Steering Committee is the TC.


# Logging Issues

Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. When in
doubt, log an issue, any additional policies about what to include
will be provided in the responses. The only exception is a security
disclosure which should be sent privately.

Committers may direct you to another repository, ask for additional
clarifications, and add appropriate metadata before the issue is
addressed.

Please be courteous and respectful.  Every participant is expected
to follow the relevant Code of Conduct (e.g. The Planetary Science
TSC's [Code of Conduct](Code-Of-Conduct.md)).

# Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull
requests (PRs). This applies to all changes to documentation, code,
binary files, etc. Even long term committers and TC members must
use pull requests.

No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

In general, the submitter of a PR is responsible for making changes
to the PR.  Any changes to the PR can be suggested by others in the
PR thread (or via PRs to the PR), but changes to the primary PR
should be made by the PR author.  In order to merge a PR, it must
satisfy both of these two conditions:

  1. have been open for 24 hours
  2. have two approvals

Pull requests should sit for at least 24 hours to ensure that
contributors in other timezones have time to review. Consideration
should also be given to weekends and other holiday periods to ensure
active committers all have reasonable time to become involved in
the discussion and review process if they wish.

In order to encourage involvement and review, we require at least
two explicit approvals from committers that are not the PR author.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no
committer has an objection, and the above two requirements are
satisfied.  During review committers may also request that a specific
contributor who is more versed in a particular area gives an approval
before the PR can be merged. There is no additional "sign off"
process for contributions to be merged. Once all issues brought by
committers are addressed it can be merged by any committer.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another
committer, all involved committers should seek to arrive at a
consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion,
compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed
change.

If a contribution is controversial and committers cannot agree about
how to get it merged or if it should merge, then it should be escalated
to the TC. TC members should regularly discuss pending contributions
in order to find a resolution. It is expected that only a small
minority of issues be brought to the TC for resolution and that
discussion and compromise among committers be the default resolution
mechanism.

Exceptions to the above are minor typo fixes or cosmetic changes
that don't alter the meaning of a document.  Those edits can be
made via a PR which only requires a single approval (not two, and
not open for 24 h) to be merged.

Some kinds of PRs have different rules (those to change the TSC
Charter, applications for TLPs and TLWGs, etc.) and will be detailed
in their respective policy documents.

# Becoming a Committer

All contributors who get a non-trivial contribution merged should
be on-boarded in a timely manner, added as a committer, and be given
write access to the repository.

Committers are expected to follow this policy and continue to send
pull requests, go through proper review, and have other committers
merge their pull requests.

# TC Process

The TC uses a "consensus seeking" process for issues that are
escalated to the TC.  The group tries to find a resolution that has
no open objections among TC members.  If a consensus cannot be
reached that has no objections then a majority wins vote is called.
It is also expected that the majority of decisions made by the TC
are via a consensus seeking process and that voting is only used
as a last resort.

Resolution may involve returning the issue to committers with
suggestions on how to move forward towards a consensus. It is not
expected that a meeting of the TC will resolve all issues on its
agenda during that meeting and may prefer to continue the discussion
happening among the committers.
