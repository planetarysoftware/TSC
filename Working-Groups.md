# Planetary Software Organization Top-Level Working Groups

Planetary Software Organization Top-Level Working Groups (TLWGs)
are autonomous projects typically initiated by the [Technical
Steering Committee (TSC)](TSCcharter), but external individuals can
also submit an application to form a TLWG.

Top-Level Working Groups can be formed at any time but must go
through the TLWG [lifecycle process](Lifecycle.md) and be approved
by the TSC.  Once formed, the work defined in the TLWG charter is
the responsibility of the TLWG rather than the TSC.

It is important that TLWGs are not formed pre-maturely. TLWGs are
not formed to *begin* a set of tasks but instead are
formed once that work is already underway and the contributors think
it would benefit from being carried out as an autonomous project.

When the work defined in a TLWG's charter is complete, the TLWG will
stand down, and the charter will be revoked.

A TLWG's charter can be revoked either by consent of the Working
Group's members or by a TSC vote.

## Joining a TLWG

To find out how to join a working group, consult its Charter or
Contributing document in the TLWG's repository.

## Starting a Top Level Working Group

To start a top level working group, become familiar with the
[lifecycle of a TLWG](Lifecycle.md), and read through the [example
documents](Bootstrap-Policies/) to get started.
