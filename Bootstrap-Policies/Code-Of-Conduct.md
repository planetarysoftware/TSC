## Working Group Code of Conduct Template

Every Working Group must have a Code of Conduct. By default,
all working groups fall under the [Planetary Software Organization Code of Conduct][]
but Working Groups can choose to define their own alternative policy.
If the Working Group does choose its own Code of Conduct, it must be
documented in a `Code-Of-Conduct.md` file located in the root of any
repository under their stewardship.

Note that the Code of Conduct adopted by a Working Group will be evaluated
by the TSC prior to ratifying the WG's proposed charter. If that Code of
Conduct is considered to be weaker than, or diverges too significantly from,
the [Planetary Software Organization Code of Conduct][], the TSC may defer
accepting the charter until corrections are made.

Likewise, if the WG's Code of Conduct changes after the WG has already been
chartered and the TSC determines that the updated Code of Conduct is weaker
than, or diverges too significantly from, the [Planetary Software Organization Code of Conduct][],
the TSC (or any Collaborator) may request that further corrections be made by
opening an issue or a PR in the WG's repository. Should the WG choose not to
adopt the recommended changes, the TSC may choose to revoke the WGs charter.
