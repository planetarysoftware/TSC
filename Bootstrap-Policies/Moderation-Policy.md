## Working Group Moderation Policy Template

Every Working Group must have a Moderation Policy. By default,
all working groups under the Planetary Software Organization fall under
the [Planetary Software Organization Moderation Policy][], but Working Groups
can choose to define their own alternative policy. If the Working Group does
choose it's own Moderation Policy, it must be documented in a
`Moderation-Policy.md` file located in the root of any repository under
their stewardship.

Note that the Moderation Policy adopted by a Working Group will be evaluated
by the TSC prior to ratifying the WG's proposed charter. If that Moderation
Policy is considered to be weaker than, or diverges too significantly from,
the [Planetary Software Organization Moderation Policy][], the TSC may defer
accepting the charter until corrections are made.

Likewise, if the WG's Moderation Policy changes after the WG has already been
chartered and the TSC determines that the updated Moderation Policy is weaker
than, or diverges too significantly from, the [Planetary Software Organization Moderation Policy][], the
TSC (or any Collaborator) may request that further corrections be made by
opening an issue or a PR in the WG's repository. Should the WG choose not to
adopt the recommended changes, the TSC may choose to revoke the WGs charter.
