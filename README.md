# The Planetary Software Organization

The Planetary Software Organization promotes open source software
in the planetary sciences by helping software creators and maintainers
foster an open source community.

The Planetary Software Organization helps software creators grow
and organize their community by providing a set of ready-to-use
community guidelines, standards, and governance documents.  The 
Planetary Software Organization also helps software maintainers 
manage the growth and evolution of their open source software by 
providing mentorship and suggestions.

## The Planetary Software Organization Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the governing body of the
Planetary Software Organization, as described in its
[Charter](TSC-Charter.md).

The TSC primarily provides responsive input and organizational help
to its Top-Level Projects and Working Groups, but is also available
for consultation by other software projects or endeavors.

Other governing documents for the TSC are located in the root
folder of this repository.


## Strategic Initiatives

At any one time the Planetary Software projects have a number of strategic initiatives
underway.  The goal of the TSC is to have a champion for each of these
initiatives and to support the initiatives in order to enable their
success.

## Policy Change Proposal Process

The Planetary Software TSC is chartered to oversee the technical governance of all Top
Level Projects and Working Groups under the Planetary Software Organization. The TSC
establishes the default governance, conduct, and licensing policies for all Top-Level 
Projects. Top-Level Projects and Working Groups have broad powers of
self-governance.

To propose a change or addition to policies or processes that are intended to
cover all Top-Level Projects and Working Groups in the Planetary Software Organization,
a PR should be opened in the `planetarysoftware/TSC` repository.

In some cases, existing individual groups have the right to refuse changes to
their charters. The TSC cannot mandate existing working groups alter their
charters. If such a situation arises, the TSC may decide to revoke the group's
charter.
