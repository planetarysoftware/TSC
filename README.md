# The Planetary Software Organization Technical Steering Committee

The Planetary Software Organization Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the technical
governing body of the Planetary Software Organization. It is described in the
[TSC Charter][].
The governing documents for the TSC are locating in the root folder of this repository.

## TSC Scope

**The TSC is responsible for those projects which are under TSC stewardship, and provides responsive input and organizational help to any projects which are not under TSC stewardship but which qualify as top level projects (TLPs).**

The TSC exercises autonomy in managing its responsibilities.


### Planetary Software projects under TSC Stewardship

### Planetary Software projects under TSC advisement

### List of TSC Responsibilities

The TSC exercises autonomy in setting up and maintaining procedures, policies,
and management and administrative structures as it deems appropriate for the
maintenance and operation of these projects and resources.

Included in the responsibilities of the TSC are:

* Managing code, documentation creation, and changes for the projects under stewardship
* Setting and maintaining standards covering contributions of code,
  documentation and other materials
* Managing code and binary releases: types, schedules, frequency, delivery
  mechanisms
* Making decisions regarding dependencies of the projects,
  including what those dependencies are and how they are bundled with source
  code and releases
* Creating new repositories and projects under the _planetarysoftware_ GitHub organization
  as required
* Setting overall technical direction for the projects under stewardship, including
  high-level goals and low-level specifics regarding features and functionality
* Setting and maintaining appropriate standards for community discourse via the
  various mediums under TSC control
* Setting and maintaining governance rules for the conduct and make-up of the
  TSC, Working Groups and other bodies within the TSC's domain

Many of these responsibilities will be delegated by the TSC to appropriate
bodies such as the Working Groups.

## TSC Members

TSC members are responsible for top level technical community concerns. The role
is mostly administrative and is primarily responsible for admitting new Top Level
Projects and Top Level Working Groups.

TSC members can nominate new members at any time. Candidates for membership tend
to be people who have a competency for community management and a high tolerance
and patience for process minutiae as the TSC delegates most of its responsibilities
to other projects and working groups.

A [current list of TSC members](https://github.com/planetarysoftware/TSC/blob/master/Members.md)
is maintained in the main TSC repository.

## Strategic Initiatives

At any one time the Planetary Software projects have a number of strategic initiatives
underway.  The goal of the TSC is to have a champion for each of these
initiatives and to support the initiatives in order to enable their
success.

## Top-Level WGs and TLPs

* [Working Groups](Working-Groups.md)
* Top-Level Projects
 * Core TLP
  * Core WGs (for example, streams)

## Policy Change Proposal Process

The Planetary Software TSC is chartered to oversee the technical governance of all Top
Level Projects and Working Groups under the Planetary Software Organization. The TSC
establishes the default governance, conduct, and licensing policies for all Top
Level Projects. Top Level Projects and Working Groups have broad powers of
self-governance.

To propose a change or addition to policies or processes that are intended to
cover all Top Level Projects and Working Groups in the foundation, a PR should
be opened in the `planetarysoftware/TSC` repository.

The pull request can be labeled `tsc-agenda` to request that it be put on the
agenda for the next TSC meeting.

In some cases, existing individual groups have the right to refuse changes to
their charters. The TSC cannot mandate existing working groups alter their
charters. If such a situation arises, the TSC may decide to revoke the group's
charter.

## Merging Pull Requests in the TSC Repo
The submitter of a pull request (PR) is responsible for making changes to the text of the PR.  Any changes to the PR can be suggested by others in the PR thread, but changes to the PR should be made by the PR author.  In order to merge a PR, it must satisfy both of these two conditions:

  1. have been open for 24 hours
  2. have two approvals

Exceptions to the above are minor typo fixes or cosmetic changes that don't alter the meaning of a document.  Those edits can be made via a PR which only requires a single approval (not two, and not open for 24 h) to be merged.
