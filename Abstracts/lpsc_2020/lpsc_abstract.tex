The Planetary Software Organization promotes open source software
in the planetary sciences by helping software creators and maintainers
foster an open source community. More information can be found at
its web page: \url{https://github.com/planetarysoftware/TSC}.


The Planetary Software Organization helps software creators grow
and organize their community by providing a set of ready-to-use
community guidelines, standards, and governance documents. The
Planetary Software Organization also helps software maintainers
manage the growth and evolution of their open source software by
providing mentorship and suggestions.

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the governing body of the
Planetary Software Organization, as described in its Charter. The TSC
was formed in 2018 and was modeled after the nodejs TSC. The nodejs
TSC charter was utilized as a template because it is a well developed 
framework for software governance for a large organization. 

The TSC primarily provides responsive input and organizational help
to its Top-Level Projects and Working Groups, but is also available
for consultation by other software projects or endeavors.
